Project Name: 
MUNGTOON
The inspiration for the name came from the Korean word “멍” (pronounced as ‘mung’). In Korea, the barking of dogs is written as “멍멍". Also, 멍 on its own is a state when a person is dozed off and in their head. We thought it would be cute to add mung and toon (from cartoon)
Project Description:
What is the project, what is the overall concept and theme, and what kind of experience you were striving to create.
The project is a comic showcasing the different ‘moods’ experienced by a dog shown on each side of an interactive cube. The user can use the buttons or the arrows on the keyboard to switch the sides to view the scene associated with each mood. There are six moods in total - anger (red), happiness (yellow), boredom (grey), sadness (blue), dark green (fear), orange (excited). 
The story is not a linear one. There is no time progression between each scene. The interactivity of the cube embodies the non-linear progression of the narrative. The user can always switch between each side - regardless of the sequence - and make sense of the theme of the comic through interacting with it directly. They will quickly realize the different colors between the scenes and the moods of the dog through the animation. 


Process: 
How did you go about implementing the concept?
Ideation [also refer to pdf document on github]:
During the ideation stage, we had multiple ideas in mind. All of the ideas had a common concept of showcasing various sides of a character using the flexible interface of the website. We thought using the shape of a cube would be ideal as it has six sides and we could present each scene on a side. The user can interact with the cube to access the different sides and moods of the character. 
We decided to make our main character a dog. The medium of a comic allows more room for creativity and we wanted to make use of that. Also, we discussed how we enjoyed works where non-human things / creatures are given human characteristics. Deciding on the dog character also simplified the number of moods that it can have - compared to a human. 
To present this idea in a visual way, we decided to use different colors to portray the mood of the dog. We searched up qualities that each color typically represents and associated each mood and side with a color. 
We wanted to make sure the content in each frame was simple enough to not confuse the user. To do so, we decided to change only two variables between each frame - the color (which represents the mood) and the factor causing that mood from the dog. For example, the red frame which represents anger has a criminal threatening the owner which invokes anger from the dog. In the yellow frame, the warm sun from the window invokes a happy mood from the dog. 
We made the decision of keeping text at a minimum to direct the attention of the user to the cube and the visuals of the comic as they are the focus of the interaction. 
Coding
When animating the cube, we had to decide between using javascript for the actual rotation of the cube or using css. Given that we intended for the faces of the cube to be constantly displayed, to maintain the shape of the cube throughout the use of the website, we opted for css which gave us the ability to assign classes to the face of the cube that was facing forward while still having the cube displayed as a whole. This allowed our transitions between the different faces of the cube to showcase the 3D shape of the cube while rotating, using transformations to turn the different faces of the cube to different sides, while ensuring that the cube was still connected as a whole. 
Our use of radio buttons to rotate  the cube ensured a more aesthetically appealing means of navigating the different panels of the comic as our initial idea of using a mouse tracker would make the user interface harder to navigate. We set the radio buttons using javascript in order to attach a function to the radio buttons whereby each radio button corresponded to a face. We did this by using the class names of the different faces of the cubes to a variable in javascript that was able to get the true/false value of the radio boxes (whether they were checked or not) and connect this value with the class of the face that was selected. 
The timer was more of a challenge when coding as we had to ensure that the timer was only started after the last panel the user clicked on, as opposed to the first. We also had to ensure that the radio button also returned to the first radio button as opposed to only the face of the cube changing. However, through Jack’s help and resources on using the setTimeout function, we figured out how to combine two functions to solve these issues. We were able to use the variable timerCount to assess how many times the user changed the panel, and ensure that the 5 seconds only occurred after the user stopped changing the panels. 
Stylistic Choices
We decided to keep the style of the comic on the simpler side. In one of the chapters of McCloud comic, he mentions how readers are more captivated by iconic images due to their simplicity. Also, the simplicity allows for a stronger emotional connection as there are less distractions from the core change that is happening - the change in facial expressions and actions. We also had a preference for a  simpler style in general, from our personal experience. 
For the color scheme, we chose colors leaning more towards the brighter and pastel side to fit the light aesthetic of the comics. We also included an uplifting background music to go along with that. 
As mentioned before, we kept the text at a minimum. The only text that is shown in the website is the title “MUNGTOON”. To fit the simplistic and cute aesthetic of the website, we chose a pixel-art styled font for the title. 
Comic Animation
We wanted to incorporate a mix of digital and hand drawn illustrations. For the digital illustrations, we used Illustrator to create svg backgrounds for each frame. Using the pen tool, we outlined the base image and filled it in with colors of our choice that fit our color scheme. After creating all the svg background files, we used procreate to hand draw the characters and animate them. We used a combination of procreate and gif creator for the animations through layers. As we divided the work for the comic, choosing a simplistic style allowed for a more uniform look between the frames. 
Reflection/Evaluation: 
This should bookend the initial concept and talk about whether your expectations and goals were met in the process of building the final working version.


Our initial idea for the comic is largely represented in the final working version. Throughout the process of coding, we made some adjustments to the interactivity which in turn changed the features that we included in the website. For example, the sound which we initially intended to change based on the forward facing face became background music as we added the feature of a timer which triggered the return to a default happy face of the cube. Our initial idea for the cube was to display the different emotions of a dog, but in the process of deciding on the interactivity of the comic and deciding on a timer that would return to the original face, we tweaked the idea to represent the natural happiness of dogs, whereby their emotions are rarely negative for long periods of time. Our expectations with the comic were met in the overall atmosphere and vibe we aimed to create with our website as the happy music that constantly plays in the background emphasized the natural joy of dogs, even through temporarily  negative emotions. The title and simple design of the website that we landed on, as opposed to a more explanatory landing page complimented our initial goal for the website even more than our initial design. 


During the first few meetings for ideation, we were all interested in representing different parts of an individual. To present this, one of the ideas we looked into was having panels or content that appear when through the zooming process, when the user scrolls the image. However, we settled upon the interactive idea of a cube since when we decided to work on different emotions of a dog, our character, it could better represent the state of a dog that would be independent of other emotional sides - just like seeing a side of a cube, we do not see other sides of the cube, when we acknowledge all sides are part of the cube. This was a really interesting approach to represent different parts of the character. However, we were faced with the limitation that the scene may not accurately represent the emotion of the character with a single panel for an emotion. To solve this, we came up with two solutions: animation and usage of color. We worked on animated png and gif to have an animation of the character to better convey the message. Furthermore to better communicate the emotional state that the dog is in, we used different colors that represent each emotion to better express. The process of having to reach a goal by solving multiple problems we faced with creative solutions  was definitely a fun and challenging process.
